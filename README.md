Fully functioning text editor inside the terminal. Made in only 1 C file and ~700 lines of code.
Able to import, edit, and export text files, as well as creating files from scratch.

To import a text file run the excecutable along side the file name; eg: ./kilo <example.txt>

To create a file just run the executable on its own.
